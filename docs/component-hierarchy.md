## Component Hierarchy

**AuthFormContainer**

**HeaderContainer**
- NavbarLoggedIn - NavBar will be set as true if logged in.
- NavbarLoggedOut - NavBar will be set as false if logged out.

This will be the Home page.

- StepOneForm

Forms will fill out in order: property_type, space details, max_guests, title and description, amenity, cancellation policy, price

This looks very cumbersome.....
